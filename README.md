# Hex-Assist
 Foundry VTT Module to help make your Hex Crawl more enjoyable

# Macros
 Included in Hex-Assist are 2 Macros. One to run your hex crawl adventure, and one to make any invisible hex tiles visible again!

# Setup
 Hex-Assist requires some things on your part.
 -Marker Tokens: A token named Player Location for the players to see their location, and a GM token (hidden) named Actual Location
 -Hex Tiles: Whatever map you are "crawling" through needs tiles on it named "tile.png" that cover the hexes.
 -Rollable Tables: The macro uses various rollable tables for morning/afternoon/evening events. I would include these, but the ones I have are straight out of ToA and I can't distribute them.
    -Table names: coast, jungle1, jungle2, jungle3, mountains, rivers, ruins, swamp, wasteland, cache, treasure, weather, directions, deadexplorers
    The names are pretty self explanitory. directions must have: North, Northwest, Northeast, South, Southwest, and Southeast or your tokens won't move!

# Use
 Once you've got everything setup, you need to select your navigator (the one that will be making a blind survival check, I reccomend keeping all the player tokens on the map in the GM layer for easy selection) and press the Hex Crawler macro.
 From here, you will pick the Hex type they are currently on, Ask the players what direction, if they are near a river and have a canoe ask them if they are using a canoe, and if they are going at a slow, average, or fast pace.
 After detirmining those things, press the pace, and it's off to exploring!
 In the chat you will see: Weather, notes on pace, How far the party moved, if they are lost (no message if they aren't), and morning/afternoon/evening encounters listed out.
 Repeat until you kill your party!
